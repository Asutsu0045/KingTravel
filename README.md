Work in progress The game prototype, based on the Godot engine, will be developed in future updates. It's currently in development, so it's not a very long game. Everything is open-source and can be modified using the Godot engine. 
Enjoy!

In the next update, I plan to add a main menu and a sprinting algorithm, and extend the map to about 1 hour of gameplay.
